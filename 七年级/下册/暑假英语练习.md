My friend Brett had just got a motorbike. A lot of other 1.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in my neighborhood came to ride it. I also wanted to.

<div class="wordsToFill mb-3">use　gift　usual　what　but　try　surprise　collect　about　they</div>

Like most people, you probably have problems in your life that you need to solve. Maybe you try very hard every year to pick out different birthday 1.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for your family. Maybe you try your best to get to school on time 2.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ you still arrive late. And since these matters are personal, it can be hard to be <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="客观的">objective</a> about them. But what if you step back and think like a scientist? You might be 3.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at the ways you come up with.

Walter A. Shewhart once wrote a book 4.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ using the scientific method in business. He argued that businesses should be improving 5.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ products all the time. He used a circle, or cycle, to explain his idea. His student W. Edwards Deming turned Shewhart’s thoughts into a four-step cycle. This became the PDCA Cycle — Plan, Do, Check and Act 一 that is 6.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by many people today.
<ol>
<li>Plan

Think about your problem and form a <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="假设">hypothesis</a> for how to solve it. Let’s say you want to get to school on time. 7.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ you take the bus. But today, you get up late. So you decide to ask your mom to take you on her motorbike instead.</li>
<li>Do

Now it's time to put your plan to the test. This is also the time when you start to 8.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="数据">data</a>. Be sure to take notes of important information such as the time you arrive at school.</li>
<li>Check

Consider the result of your experiment. Did you get to school on time? 9.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ other <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="因素">factors</a> are there? Maybe riding with your mom can be faster. But if it rains, you will get wet.</li>
<li>Act

Now you put your changes into action and 10.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ your new <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="假设">hypothesis</a> again. Perhaps you find that it's faster to ride with your mom. But you need to take a raincoat.</li>
</ol>

Keep repeating the cycle so that you can improve all the time.

There was a king named Bauakas. He was told that there lived a just judge who could tell the 1.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in one of his cities. The king wante to find out the truth. 2.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ he exchanged clothes with a businessman and traveled on horseback.

On the way, a beggar went 3.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Bauakas, <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="乞讨">begged</a> for money and asked for a ride.

Then they asked the judge for help. First the judge listened to a scholar and a peasant about whose wife the woman was, and then he said, “5.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the woman with me, and return tomorrow.”

When his 6.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ came, Bauakas told the judge what had happened. The judge listened 7.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and said, “Leave the horse with me, and return tomorrow.”

The following day, the judge first told the scholar, “Take your wife. The peasant will 8.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ fifty <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="鞭打">lashes</a>.”

Next he led Bauakas and the beggar to the <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="马厩">stable</a>. Bauakas immediately <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="认出">recognized</a> his horse.

“The horse is 9.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,” the judge directed Bauakas. “The beggar will be given fifty <a style="border-bottom: 1px dotted black" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="bottom" title="鞭打">lashes</a>.”

## 附加题

Has all \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can be done \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

A. what; done　　B. that; already done　　C. what; already　　D. what; been done

## 答案与解析

1. **A**。 【定语从句】填空句为定语从句，主句“the mobile phone is one of the greatest inventions”，从句“(one of the greatest inventions) have changed our life”。先行词（括号部分），被最高级修饰；从句缺少主语（括号部分需要被替换），因此只能用that。

2. **A**。 【现在完成时】“It’s clean and tidy now.”说明房间内卫生的具体情况，与现在有关，故用have cleaned。

3. **A**。 【过去时】“when he was away from home on business”，交代具体时间点，故用called。

4. **D**。 【感叹句】陈述句语序为“You can’t imagine we had difficulty solving the problem.”（你无法想象我们解决问题时的困难），注意短语“have fun/difficult/trouble... (in) doing sth.”。 感叹句语序调整，不影响动词形式。在这里，“we had difficulty solving the problem”（我们解决问题时的困难）修改为了“what difficulty we had solving the problem”（我们解决问题时的困难有多大啊）。感叹句：what + n. + 原句语序 或 how + adj./adv. + 原句语序。

    附加题 **B**。 【定语从句】主句“has all already done”，从句“all can be done”。

—When it started to rain, I was walking in the street. So I got all wet.

—I was no luckier than you. I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ my bike.

A. rode　　B. have ridden　　C. was riding　　D. had ridden

## 答案与解析

1. **B**。 【连接词】Anyway adv. 无论如何/不过 在此为口语化的表达“而且”，意思近似。<br /> then adv. 当时/那时/总之<br />instead adv. 原本想…却… instead of 而不是…<br />however adv. 无论如何/然而 = no matter how
2. **A**。 【炼词】so + adj. / adv.，但名词前有much / many / few / little等应用“so”。<br />such + n.
3. **C**。 【过去进行时】阅读情景可知，“我”在下雨天骑车。riding可用于“正在骑”，与过去时构成过去进行时：was riding。（从理解角度讲，“I was no luckier than you.” 说明“我”也骑了很久）
