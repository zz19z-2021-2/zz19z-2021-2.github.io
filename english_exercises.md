今天的习题是：**4道单项选择题（必做）**和1道附加题（选做）。

## 第1题

—Now I can’t live without mobile phones.

—To be honest, the mobile phone is one of the greatest inventions \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ have changed our life.

<p style="white-space: pre">A. that        B. which        C. who        D. what</p>

## 第2题

—Alex, go and clean your bedroom.

—I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ it. It’s clean and tidy now. Mind your own business.

<p style="white-space: pre">A. have cleaned        B. cleaned        C. clean        D. will clean</p>


## 第3题

Adam \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ his family every day when he was away from home on business.

<p style="white-space: pre">A. called        B. was calling        C. calls        D. is calling</p>

## 第4题

You can’t imagine what difficulty we had \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the problem.

<p style="white-space: pre">A. to solve        B. solve        C. solved        D. solving</p>

## 附加题

Has all \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can be done \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

<p style="white-space: pre">A. what; done        B. that; already done        C. what; already        D. what; been done</p>

## 答案与解析

1. **A**。 【定语从句】填空句为定语从句，主句“the mobile phone is one of the greatest inventions”，从句“(one of the greatest inventions) have changed our life”。先行词（括号部分），被最高级修饰；从句缺少主语（括号部分需要被替换），因此只能用that。

2. **A**。 【现在完成时】“It’s clean and tidy now.”说明房间内卫生的具体情况，与现在有关，故用have cleaned。

3. **A**。 【过去时】“when he was away from home on business”，交代具体时间点，故用called。

4. **D**。 【感叹句】陈述句语序为“You can’t imagine we had difficulty solving the problem.”（你无法想象我们解决问题时的困难），注意短语“have fun/difficult/trouble... (in) doing sth.”。 感叹句语序调整，不影响动词形式。在这里，“we had difficulty solving the problem”（我们解决问题时的困难）修改为了“what difficulty we had solving the problem”（我们解决问题时的困难有多大啊）。感叹句：what + n. + 原句语序 或 how + adj./adv. + 原句语序。

    附加题 **B**。 【定语从句】主句“has all already done”，从句“all can be done”。

今天的习题是：**3道单项选择题。**

## 第1题

I am too tired to walk any more. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I am hungry.

<p style="white-space: pre">A. Then        B. Anyway        C. Instead        D. However</p>

## 第2题

Ms. Lee has \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ much housework that she can’t go for a game.

<p style="white-space: pre">A. so        B. such</p>

## 第3题

—When it started to rain, I was walking in the street. So I got all wet.

—I was no luckier than you. I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ my bike.

<p style="white-space: pre">A. rode        B. have ridden        C. was riding        D. had ridden</p>

## 答案与解析

1. **B**。 【连接词】Anyway adv. 无论如何/不过 在此为口语化的表达“而且”，意思近似。<br /> then adv. 当时/那时/总之<br />instead adv. 原本想…却… instead of 而不是…<br />however adv. 无论如何/然而 = no matter how
2. **A**。 【炼词】so + adj. / adv.，但名词前有much / many / few / little等应用“so”。<br />such + n.
3. **C**。 【过去进行时】阅读情景可知，“我”在下雨天骑车。riding可用于“正在骑”，与过去时构成过去进行时：was riding。（从理解角度讲，“I was no luckier than you.” 说明“我”也骑了很久）
