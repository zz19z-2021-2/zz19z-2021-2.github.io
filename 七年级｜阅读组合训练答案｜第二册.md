**重点话题写作（五）**
	Hi, everyone! I'm Tony. And I'm 13 years old. I am good at doing all kinds of sports, such as running, swimming, and playing basketball. If I become the "Sports Club Minister", I will let the students run for at least half an hour every morning. I believe it's never to late to do sports. Only in this way can we keep in good health.
	Give me a chance and I will show you I can be a good minister. Thank you!
<p style="text-align:right">Yours, <br/ >Tony</p>
